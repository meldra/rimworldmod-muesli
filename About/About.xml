    <description>This mod adds a recipe for Muesli to the campfire and stoves. The ingredients are berries and/or agave with rice and/or corn. The mod does not use fruits or grains added in other mods.

This is intended to be like a vegan version of pemmican for those who want an early game travel-friendly option that doesn't need meat.

Since cereal is less calorie dense than meat and fat, the nutritional value is slightly lower and work needed is slightly higher. It also costs less.

This should be safe to add to an existing game. It does not even attempt compatability with other mods, for that please check out Muesli+ (). My Muesli mods are not compatible with each other.

If you want a mod that has the whole set of vegan stove-craftable meals, check out my other mod Beyond Impossible Meals: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2177980416

Credits: This was my first mod, so I pulled a lot from existing mods to the point I lost track, but is more or less initially based on the vegan survival meals by chicken plucker with some guidance from ConZ' vegetarian meals, crustypeanut's rimcuisine 2 core, and one of the various incarnations of the smoked meat mod.
